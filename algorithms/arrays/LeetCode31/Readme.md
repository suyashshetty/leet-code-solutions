**Explanation:**

The goal is to rearrange the array into the lexicographically next permutation. 
If no such permutation exists, we return the array sorted in ascending order.

**Steps:**
Find the first decreasing element: Traverse the array from the right to find the 
first element nums[i] that is smaller than nums[i + 1]. This is where the permutation 
can be adjusted to get the next permutation.

Find the element to swap with: After identifying i, find the smallest element to the right 
of i that is larger than nums[i]. Swap these two elements to ensure we move to 
the next larger permutation.

Reverse the sequence: To get the next permutation, reverse the sequence after index i to 
get the smallest lexicographical order for that part of the array.

**Time Complexity:**
O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we perform three linear 
scans of the array (finding the first decreasing element, finding the element to swap, and reversing the subarray).

**Space Complexity:**
O(1), as the problem requires in-place rearrangement and we only use constant extra memory.




### Steps:
1. **Find the first decreasing element**:
   - Index `i = 1`, `nums[i] = 2`
   
2. **Find the element to swap**:
   - Swap `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` â†’ `[1, 3, 2]`
   
3. **Reverse the subarray**:
   - No need to reverse further as there's only one element left.

### Final Output: [1, 3, 2]
