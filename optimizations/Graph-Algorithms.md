| **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**   | Dynamic connectivity, cycle detection, and clustering within graph problems.                    | Implement the Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank. This ensures near-constant time union and find operations, ideal for handling connectivity queries and detecting cycles efficiently in large graphs.                                                                                         |
| **Heavy-Light Decomposition**         | Efficient query and update operations along paths in tree structures.                             | Decompose the tree into “heavy” and “light” segments, and combine with segment trees or BITs. This reduces complex path queries to manageable subproblems, often yielding logarithmic (or near-logarithmic) query and update times.                                                                                           |
| **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**              | Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights.                         | Utilize a min-priority queue (or Fibonacci heap) to iteratively relax edges and update distances, achieving an efficient solution for single-source shortest path problems with a time complexity of O((V + E) log V).                                                                                                              |
| **A\* Search Algorithm**              | Pathfinding in maps or graphs where an informed heuristic can drastically reduce search space.   | Incorporate an admissible heuristic to guide the search toward the target, effectively reducing the number of explored nodes compared to uninformed search methods. Particularly beneficial in large, complex maps or game AI scenarios.                                                                                           |
| **Tarjan's Offline LCA Algorithm**    | Efficient processing of multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries in trees.                   | Employ Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm combined with Union-Find to answer multiple LCA queries in nearly linear time, optimizing tree query performance in scenarios involving large datasets.                                                                                                                                    |
