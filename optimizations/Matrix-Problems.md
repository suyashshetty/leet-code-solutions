| **Strassenâ€™s Algorithm**                  | Efficient multiplication of large dense matrices.                                                | Use a divide-and-conquer approach to multiply matrices in O(n^2.807) time, which can be significantly faster than the conventional O(n^3) method for large matrices.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Cache Blocking / Tiling**               | Improving performance of matrix multiplication or convolution by optimizing memory usage.         | Partition matrices into smaller sub-blocks that fit into the CPU cache, reducing cache misses and enhancing data locality during multiplication.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Sparse Matrix Representation (CSR/CSC)**| Operations on matrices with many zero elements, common in graph and system simulations.            | Represent the matrix using Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats to reduce memory usage and accelerate operations by iterating only over non-zero elements.                                                                                                                                               |
| **2D Binary Indexed Trees (2D BIT)**      | Dynamic queries and updates on submatrix sums.                                                   | Construct a 2D BIT to support point updates and submatrix sum queries in O(log n * log m) time, making it efficient for dynamic matrix query problems.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **2D Segment Trees**                      | Range queries and updates on matrices where more complex operations than sum are needed.          | Build a 2D segment tree to support a variety of range queries (e.g., minimum, maximum, sum) and updates in logarithmic time relative to both dimensions, ideal for multi-dimensional range queries on large matrices.                                                                                                                 |
| **Summed-area Table (Prefix Sum Matrix)** | Rapid computation of submatrix sums in static matrices.                                          | Precompute a prefix sum matrix in O(n*m) time so that any submatrix sum can be queried in O(1) time, which is ideal when multiple range sum queries are required on the same matrix.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Parallel Matrix Multiplication**        | Computation-heavy matrix multiplications that can be parallelized.                                | Leverage multi-threading or GPU acceleration to distribute matrix multiplication tasks across multiple cores or devices, significantly reducing overall computation time for large matrices.                                                                                                                                        |
| **LU Decomposition / Gaussian Elimination** | Solving systems of linear equations or inverting matrices in numerical problems.                | Factorize the matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices (LU Decomposition) to solve systems of equations more efficiently. Incorporate partial pivoting in Gaussian elimination to improve numerical stability.                                                                                                               |
| **Iterative Methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel)**| Approximating solutions for large, sparse linear systems where direct methods are too costly.       | Use iterative methods such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel to converge on an approximate solution with lower memory and time complexity than direct solvers, particularly useful for very large systems where an exact solution is not necessary.                                                                                           |
| **Binary Search on Sorted Matrix**              | Searching for a target in a matrix that is sorted row-wise and/or column-wise.                     | Exploit the sorted properties by either performing binary search on each row or using the "staircase" method (starting at the top-right or bottom-left) to achieve O(m+n) time complexity.                                                                                                                                |
| **DP with Space Optimization (Rolling Arrays)** | Grid-based dynamic programming problems (e.g., Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum) with large matrices. | Replace a full 2D DP table with a 1D rolling array to reduce space complexity from O(m*n) to O(n), updating the array iteratively as you traverse rows or columns.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **In-Place Transformation**                     | Matrix problems requiring modifications without extra space (e.g., Rotate Image, Set Matrix Zeroes).   | Optimize memory usage by performing operations directly on the matrix using careful indexing and in-place swapping, thus avoiding additional storage overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **DFS/BFS in Grid/Matrix**                      | Traversing or searching grid-based graphs (e.g., Number of Islands, Maze Solving).                | Use DFS or BFS to explore connected components. Mark cells as visited directly within the matrix to prevent redundant traversals, thereby improving runtime efficiency for large grids.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Union-Find for Grid Connectivity**            | Problems like Number of Islands that require counting connected components in a grid.             | Flatten the matrix into a 1D representation and apply union-find to merge adjacent (e.g., 4-directionally connected) cells efficiently. This method helps count connected regions in near-linear time relative to the number of cells.                                                                                              |
| **Memoization in DFS on Matrix**                | Grid-based searches with overlapping subproblems (e.g., Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix).       | Cache the results of DFS calls in a memoization table, so that each cell's result is computed only once. This reduces redundant computations and significantly speeds up the overall process.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Multi-Source BFS**                            | Problems requiring shortest distances from multiple starting points (e.g., Walls and Gates).         | Initialize the BFS queue with all source cells simultaneously. Expanding uniformly from all sources allows the algorithm to compute the shortest distance in one pass, rather than running separate BFS for each source.                                                                                                           |
| **Bitmask DP for Matrix-based States**          | Optimization in puzzles or board games where the state of the matrix can be represented compactly.  | Use bitmasking to encode the state of a small matrix or board. Apply dynamic programming over these bitmask states to efficiently explore transitions, which is particularly useful for combinatorial grid puzzles.                                                                                                                  |
| **Monotonic Queue for Matrix Windows**          | Sliding window problems on matrix rows/columns (e.g., finding maximum/minimum in submatrices).        | Employ a monotonic deque to maintain candidate values within a sliding window. This approach efficiently computes the maximum or minimum in each window, and can be extended to 2D by processing rows or columns sequentially before merging the results.                                                                              |
