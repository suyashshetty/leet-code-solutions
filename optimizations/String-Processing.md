This results in an overall O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the text length and m is the pattern length.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Longest Common Extension (LCE) with RMQ**  | Fast computation of the longest common prefix between arbitrary substrings.                      | Precompute the suffix array and the corresponding LCP array, then build a Range Minimum Query (RMQ) structure over the LCP array. This setup allows LCE queries to be answered in O(1) time after preprocessing, making it effective for duplicate substring detection and string comparison tasks.                              |
| **Manacher's Algorithm**                    | Finding the longest palindromic substring in a given text efficiently.                           | Transform the string (e.g., by inserting delimiters) to handle even-length palindromes uniformly, then use a center-expansion technique to compute palindromic spans in linear time (O(n)). This method identifies the longest palindromic substring with minimal overhead.                                                    |
