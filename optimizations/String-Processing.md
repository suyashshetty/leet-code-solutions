| **Suffix Trees / Suffix Arrays**      | String pattern matching and substring queries on large text datasets.                             | Construct suffix trees or suffix arrays to enable rapid substring searches and frequency counts. These structures support efficient pattern matching in linear or near-linear preprocessing time.                                                                                                                               |
| **Rabin-Karp / Rolling Hash**         | String matching in large texts where multiple pattern searches are required.                      | Apply rolling hash techniques (as in the Rabin-Karp algorithm) to compute hash values for substrings efficiently, enabling rapid pattern matching and detection with reduced time complexity.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm** | Efficient substring search and pattern matching in large texts.                                  | Preprocess the pattern to create a prefix table that allows skipping unnecessary comparisons. This results in an overall O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the text length and m is the pattern length.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Aho-Corasick Algorithm**             | Multi-pattern string matching in a single pass over the text.                                      | Build a Trie of multiple patterns augmented with failure links. Process the text in one pass to detect all pattern occurrences in time linear to the length of the text plus the total length of the patterns.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Trie (Prefix Tree)**                 | Fast retrieval, auto-complete, and prefix-based queries in applications handling large dictionaries or string sets.         | Construct a Trie where each node represents a character. Insertion and lookup operations run in time proportional to the string length, making it ideal for efficiently processing numerous string queries.                                                                                                                              |
| **Manacher's Algorithm**               | Finding the longest palindromic substring in a given text efficiently.                           | Transform the string (e.g., by inserting delimiters) to handle even-length palindromes uniformly, then use a center-expansion technique to compute palindromic spans in linear time (O(n)). This method identifies the longest palindromic substring with minimal overhead.                                                           |
| **Sliding Window / Two Pointers**      | Contiguous substring problems, such as finding the longest substring with K distinct characters.  | Maintain a dynamic window using two pointers to efficiently traverse the string. Adjust the window's boundaries based on the problem constraints to achieve O(n) complexity, ensuring each character is processed a limited number of times.                                                                                          |
| **Suffix Automaton**                   | Counting distinct substrings or identifying the longest repeated substring in a text.             | Build a suffix automaton in linear time to compactly represent all substrings of the text. This data structure enables efficient queries regarding substring frequency and distinct substring counts, which is particularly useful for advanced pattern matching problems.                                                          |

| **Z-Algorithm**                           | Pattern matching and computing prefix matches quickly in strings.                                | Compute the Z-array in O(n) time to determine, for each index, the longest substring starting at that index which matches the prefix of the string. This technique is valuable for pattern matching, detecting string periodicity, and solving various substring search problems efficiently.                                       |
| **Longest Common Extension (LCE) with RMQ** | Fast computation of the longest common prefix between arbitrary substrings.                      | Precompute the suffix array and the corresponding Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array, then build a Range Minimum Query (RMQ) structure over the LCP array. This setup allows LCE queries to be answered in O(1) time after preprocessing, making it effective for duplicate substring detection and string comparison tasks.                |
| **Eertree (Palindromic Tree)**            | Efficient enumeration and querying of all unique palindromic substrings in a text.                 | Construct an Eertree in O(n) time to store all palindromic substrings dynamically. This specialized structure facilitates rapid queries related to palindromes (such as counting unique palindromes or finding the longest palindromic substring), which is particularly useful in palindrome-centric problems.             |
